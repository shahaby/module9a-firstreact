# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description

This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned

- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx
- How to force push to github

## Challenges

I created the repo on Github before creating the react project locally and had to force push my local files to the repo. I also had to search for a new profile photo on Unsplash as the original link returned a 404 error.
